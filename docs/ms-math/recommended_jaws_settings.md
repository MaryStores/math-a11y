## Enabling MathCAT

The default math engine in JAWS has known issues when speaking digital
math content. For JAWS to work its best at speaking digital math
content, it needs to have MathCAT enabled via the “Early Adopter
Program” dialog. To enable it:

1.  Open JAWS

2.  Open the “Early Adopter Program” dialog from "Options" \> "Early
    Adopter Program..."

3.  Make sure the “MathCAT” checkbox is checked

4.  Activate the “OK” button to close the dialog

5.  Be sure to restart JAWS

## MathCAT Settings

To access the math settings in JAWS:

1.  Open the JAWS Settings Center. It can be accessed from the JAWS
    dialog via menu at “Utilities” \> “Settings Center”

2.  Find the Math settings by searching for “Math” in the search box

3.  In the search results list box, navigate the tree to the “Math
    Verbosity” entry

4.  Switch to the “Speech” page in the dialog by pressing ‘F6’

5.  Configure the Speech settings to the following:

    1.  Speech Style: ClearSpeak

    2.  Math Verbosity: Verbose

6.  Activate the “Apply” button

7.  Activate the “OK” button to close the JAWS Settings Center

# To Copy a Math Expression with JAWS (MathCAT)

When you reach a math expression, it should be read aloud followed by
the words “Math Content”. To copy the expression:

- Press “Enter” to bring up the “Math Viewer”. This will appear as a new
  window that pops up

- After it speaks all the new window information, JAWS should speak the first term of the expression 

- Use the up arrow key to until the entire express is spoken aloud or
  you hear “Zoomed out all the way”

- Press “control + c”. You should hear JAWS say “Copied selection to
  clipboard”

- Press “Escape” to close the “Math Viewer” window
